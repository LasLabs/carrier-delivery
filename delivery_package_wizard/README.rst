=======================
Delivery Package Wizard
=======================

This module intercepts calls to the ``Send to Shipper`` button in Stock
Pickings. It enforces that all packages on a picking have a packaging type
selected, which allows for dimensional calculation of shipping rates.

Usage
=====

Complete a picking as usual. You will be prompted to select packaging types for
any ``stock.quant.picking`` related to the picking that does not already have the
data.
